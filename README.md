## 🔍 Problem Statement

Manual irrigation systems often result in **over-watering** or **under-watering** due to the lack of real-time environmental analysis.  
This leads to:

- Water wastage  
- Reduced crop yield  
- Labor inefficiency  

---

## ✅ Solution

A **Smart Irrigation System** powered by **Machine Learning** predicts the water requirements for different farm sections using 20 environmental and soil parameters such as:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Soil Moisture
- pH
- Rainfall
- Solar Radiation
- Wind Speed
- Nutrient Levels  
  ...and more

The model outputs **ON/OFF** irrigation statuses for **three distinct land parcels**, enabling **precision irrigation** and resource optimization.

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. Collected and preprocessed environmental sensor data.
2. Built and trained a machine learning model to predict irrigation requirements.
3. Developed a **Streamlit app** to allow live predictions.
4. Supported two input modes:
   - **Slider-based input**
   - **CSV-based sensor input**
5. Displayed irrigation status (ON/OFF) for 3 land parcels.
